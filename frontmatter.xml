        <title>About the author</title>

        <p>Hi, this is Howard writing. I'm a first year student studying Applied Science at the University of British Columbia.</p>

        <p>As you might be able to tell, I'm pretty interested in mathematics. Other hobbies of mine include being stupid, being dumb, and having a horrible sleep schedule.</p>

        <p>If you're reading this and happen to be a fellow UBC student, then maybe we'll bump into each other on campus one day. Who knows?</p>

        <title>About this project</title>

        <p>I suppose that this website isn't your average PreTeXt project. Treat it more as a personal site of sorts, which just happens to be authored using PreTeXt, because I wanted to try it out.</p>

        <p>I don't know whether you'll particularly enjoy reading what I've got to offer, but I hope that at the very least, you'll be able to learn something new, or consider something that you've never thought of before.</p>

        <p>If you like what you see, notice a typo, or want to provide constructive criticism, feel free to send an email my way â€” my student email is ho2718@student.ubc.ca.</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
