<p>I suppose that this website isn't your average PreTeXt project. Treat it more as a personal site of sorts, which just happens to be authored using PreTeXt, because I wanted to try it out.</p>
<p>I don't know whether you'll particularly enjoy reading what I've got to offer, but I hope that at the very least, you'll be able to learn something new, or consider something that you've never thought of before.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, notice a typo, or want to provide constructive criticism, feel free to send an email my way â€” my student email is ho2718@student.ubc.ca.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="preface.html#paragraphs-2">in-context</a></span>
